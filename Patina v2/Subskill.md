While most of what characters might want to do is resolved by finding the closest applicable [[Skill]], there are some things which are sufficiently specialized knowledge or practice that even an otherwise skillful character must further invest time in training and study in order to be able to do them.

These are covered by Subskills. The full set of potential Subskills will largely be un-documented in this system document, as they usually correspond to hyper-local or hyper-specific things which might come up during play and become available to a character, or which need to be tuned to a character's particular backstory.

For example, one might be skilled in [[Esoterica]], but that on its own is not sufficient for them to correctly perform the duties and rituals of a shaman of Paradise Island, to manipulate the [[Information Layer]] to perform acts of telekinesis, and to devise a method to graft a tertiary soul onto a [[Lycanthrope]] all with the same general skill even if those things are each forms of Esoterica.

Enter subskills - these are secondary skills associated with a controlling skill whose maximum rank is equal to that of the controlling skill. Subskills can apply in two ways:

1. As a prerequisite for a specialized task that still uses the corresponding general skill for the actual test. For example, attacking might still use [[Warfare]], but training in a martial art to a certain rank might enable different kinds of attacks.
2. As a replacement for the general skill, in cases where the specialized application is just innately highly different. E.g. [[Esoterica]] is a general controlling skill for all manner of supernatural practice, but [[Telekinesis]] and [[Ritual Summoning]] are just totally different applications of it, and general esoteric knowledge only opens the door.
