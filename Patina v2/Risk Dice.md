When pushing the limits of their skills by spending from [[Pool|Pools]], characters can overextend and get a better conversion rate. The cost of doing this is that for each such point spent, the player must roll a d10 [[Risk Dice]]. 

Any dice showing 1, 2, or 3 add a [[Complication]], an unintended and sometimes negative side-effect to the completion of the task - these are generally things like ending up in an unintended position, accidentally modifying the environment, or at worst inflicting minor short-term status conditions. Multiple such results increase the potential severity of the complication and angle it more towards being strictly negative. 

On the other hand, dice showing 10 are Criticals. They player may choose to use these in three ways:
- It can cancel out a Complication on this roll
- If applicable, it can add a beneficial side-effect or excess success to the completion of the task.
- It can be spent to recover 3 points worth of the Pool that was spent on the roll.
