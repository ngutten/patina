When pushing the limits of their skills by spending from [[Pool|Pools]], characters can overextend and get a better conversion rate. The cost of doing this is that for each such point spent, the player must roll a d10 [[Risk Dice]]. 

Any dice showing 1, 2, or 3 add a Minor [[Complication]], an unintended and sometimes negative side-effect to the completion of the task - these are generally things like ending up in an unintended position, accidentally modifying the environment, or at worst inflicting minor short-term status conditions. Multiple such results on a single roll combine to form a Major [[Complication]], which is always negative for the character and can include effects up to full on injury, dropping gear, or serious environmental consequences. More than two complications on a risk roll don't further combine into worse categories, but may inform the specifics and overall complexity of the complication.

Complications can be adjudicated in a free-form manner appropriate to the situation, or the player or GM may decide instead to determine the Complication by rolling on an appropriate chart. Extra complications beyond two may be used by the GM to adjust the rolled result up or down by up to that excess number in order to find a worse result.

On the other hand, dice showing 10 are Criticals. They player may choose to use these in three ways:
- It can cancel out a Complication on this roll
- If applicable, it can add a beneficial side-effect or excess success to the completion of the task.
- It can be spent to recover 3 points worth of the Pool that was spent on the roll.
