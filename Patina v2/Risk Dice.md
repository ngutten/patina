When spending from [[Pool|Pools]] while [[Fatigue|Fatigued]] characters can overextend and get a better conversion rate. The cost of doing this is that for each such point spent, the GM will roll a d10 [[Risk Dice]]. 

Any dice showing 1 add a [[Complication]], an unintended and sometimes negative side-effect to the completion of the task - these are generally things like ending up in an unintended position, accidentally modifying the environment, or at worst inflicting minor short-term status conditions. Multiple such results increase the potential severity of the complication and angle it more towards being strictly negative.
