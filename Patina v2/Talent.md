All characters get one Talent for free. This is a freeform word describing a particular category of things the character is naturally skilled at. It should be about as narrow as a general Skill, but should not specifically correspond to the Skill categories.

For example, things like: aggression, engines, runes, spycraft, sports.

When a character's Talent applies to a given check, they gain a flat +3 to that check on top of their rank in whatever Skill or Subskill applies. The [[Genius]] [[Advantage]] increases this bonus to +5, and the [[Polymath]] [[Advantage]] allows a character to have a second Talent.
