### Tasks

The basic unit of action in Patina beyond things which can just be done automatically is the Task. A Task has a Threshold for completion (a total number of successes that must be rolled) and a Cost per roll (which is generally the time it takes, but may also involve materials, supplies, points of Pools, risk of discovery, etc).

Characters may roll a number of d10s up to the controlling Skill associated with the Task each time they pay the Cost and may spend a point of the associated [[Pool]] per extra d10 to add up to the associated Attribute in extra dice to the roll. Dice showing 7, 8, 9, or 10 are successes, which accumulate against the Threshold of the task. Once a sufficient number of successes have been rolled, the Task is completed.

Dice showing 1s indicate Complications, which can either be bought off by spending points of the associated [[Pool]] or just accepted. Complications are GM-determined, but are intended to be 'yes, but' types of things - they should not negate the change that a character was trying to create by initiating the Task in the first place, though they may (should) add other things which need to be addressed in order for the character to be satisfied with the ultimate result. Complications **can** be things that make success conditional, or things **about** what success can mean in a given situation.

For example, a character is building a bridge and rolls a Complication. The GM offers 'you can build the bridge, but you need to temporarily dam the river upstream during part of the construction'. 

A character can abort a Task at any time, but any Complications that have not been bought off still apply to the extent that it makes sense.

In the previous example of the bridge, if the character chose to abort upon hearing that Complication, any future attempts by that character to build that bridge in the same way would still require damming the river, and in general the complication has established something about the building site being difficult to work with when the river is flowing. 

If the character had bought off the Complication with Focus and but then later aborted for some reason, then future attempts would **not** need to dam the river.

Finally, in a case where the Complication only makes sense upon completion, then aborting a Task can avoid the Complication entirely. If for example a character is casting a spell and the Complication is 'you will lose control of the targeting' then choosing to stop casting will prevent that Complication from applying, and the Complication will not apply the next time the character casts the spell either.
##### Compound Tasks

Methods can chain together into larger Tasks - for example, making a sword, adding a venom reservoir, then rustproofing the entire thing. In this case, Complications can broadcast across other parts of the overall process (e.g. a Complication of the initial forging of a sword could be that the intended addition of a venom reservoir with a separate Method becomes more difficult). Methods may explicitly indicate that they can or cannot chain this way.
##### Improvised Acts

With high Skill but no specific training, a character may attempt to wing various things that fall under the scope of their Skill in the form of Improvised Acts. The main differences between Improvised Acts and normal Tasks are:
- A character cannot spend points of [[Pool]] to buy off Complications (they may still spend points to add extra dice however)
- There is a maximum number of rolls that a character can take before the Improvised Act simply fails
- The Cost, Threshold, and Skill prerequisites are not fixed (or known in advance) and can decrease the more the character understands exactly how the Improvised Act could work (through experimentation, seeing other people perform it, coherent conceptualization of the process, etc)

Essentially what this comes down to is that an Improvised Act has no guarantees - no guarantee of eventual success, that success is even possible, or even of knowing the difficulty of success. 

Once a character has succeeded even once on a particular Improvised Act, they may choose to purchase it as a [[Method]]. The success Threshold of the resulting [[Method]] is based on the Threshold for the Improvised Act at which the character succeeded - getting the threshold lower before learning it as a Method can mean a more efficient Method.

A character can try to refine a Method they have invented by retrying the action as an Improvised Act after further developing their understanding. For Methods the character invented, this induces no additional xp cost. 

In order to improve on a Method they learned from someone else, the character must effectively try it as an Improvised Act and pay the cost to re-invent the Method from scratch (after which it is their own, and they can improve it for free). The success threshold may well start higher if the character's understanding of the fundamentals is weaker than that of the original inventor of the Method.
### [[Skill]]

Skills are broad categories of competence and talent, rather than representing specific knowledge or training. A character could have a broad [[Machine Use]] skill rather than a specific skill for computers or driving cars or piloting aircraft.

Skills first and foremost act as prerequisites for being able to do certain things. Performing a certain surgery may be strictly impossible without a certain rank of [[Medicine]]. For [[Methods]] these prerequisite ranks are explicitly given; for improvised actions, it is adjudicated on the fly.

Skills also contribute to the dice rolls that determine progress towards completion of a Task, and as such can modify the time and expense of doing things. A practical example of this is that basic 'attacks' in melee combat are modeled as progression towards creating an opening to land a strike, and so the corresponding skill effectively determines the rate at which a character can land hits.

Characters start with zero in all skills, but gain free 'ghost' skill ranks from their [[Background]] (in that they do not increase the cost of buying more points of skill, and act to increase the effective skill cap). 

Skills can be advanced at a cost of 3xp for the first additional point, 6xp for the second, 9xp for the third, and so on. There is a normal cap of 5 points of skill purchases, though (independently of ghost ranks) this cap can be increased through specific [[Advantages]] or in-character opportunities. A character making a fundamental discovery in a field of science may gain the specific opportunity to break cap on their [[Science]] skill for example.
### [[Method]]

Methods are specific bits of training that a character possesses. While a character may generally be skilled in [[Medicine]], a practicing surgeon would have specific training to perform particular surgeries, particular treatments, etc.

A Method sets the base success Threshold or Thresholds and costs associated with performing a single narrow type of Task. While situational factors can modify these things, the player is always informed of what the Threshold will be when initiating the Task.

Tasks initiated through a Method cannot be involuntarily failed so long as a character consistently makes rolls to progress the Task without giving up or switching to another Task. Some Tasks can even be postponed and returned to (crafting projects for example), or may gain other specialized characteristics through the Method used to initiate them.

There is some room for variation within a Method. A character might have a Method for making swords but which allows them to vary the length of the sword, the weight of the sword, perhaps even to accept a higher success threshold in order to save materials or increase the durability. These parameters should all be part of the text of the Method worked out between the player and GM (or the text describing the Method in the base game) 

If that character wished to go further and for example design a sword with an injector for a vial of poison stored in the hilt, then that would require a separate Method applied at a different stage of the crafting process. That Method could, however, specify a means to include an extra 'integrated item slot' in any kind of object forged by blacksmithing, not just a sword and not just a poison injector - it would equally allow the crafter to make a shield with a wand slot or an anvil with a built-in heating element.

Certain basic Methods are automatically gained upon gaining the prerequisite rank of a Skill - these will be indicated with the Skill. These are things like basic attacks with weapons, running, climbing, etc, things which represent a fundamental application of the general skill.

Some Methods are available to be learned at any time a character has the prerequisite Skill level. Otherwise, it costs 1xp per Skill rank prerequisite in order to learn a Method. Some Methods may explicitly require instruction to learn or even need particular backgrounds or ritual initiations.
### [[Advantages]]

Advantages can represent both innate aspects of a character that have unique consequences, as well as things like learned habits, the consequences of training regimens, etc. Birth Advantages may only be taken at character creation, while Trained Advantages can be purchased with XP by a character who meets their prerequisites.

Advantages may also be gained (or inflicted) by in-character events.

Each Advantage has an XP cost particular to what it grants. Some Advantages have built in drawbacks as well.

Inventing new Advantages is possible but requires systematic effort towards something transformative to a character. A Trained Advantage means there is something a character is going to be doing every day from now on to maintain it. Even if XP is available, the GM may rule that the particulars of different Trained Advantages are incompatible with each-other or that a character simply does not have enough time to follow through on maintaining their multiple training regimens.
### [[Attribute]]

Attributes determine 'how much?' type questions about entities - how much injury can they take before passing out or dying, how fast can they move, how long can they hold their breath, how much can they lift? 

All entities share six basic Attributes. Beyond that, there are additional special Attributes associated with special kinds of entity or existence, or with certain kinds of fundamental forces that characters by default do not interact directly with. These additional attributes are taken to have a value of zero by default and cannot be raised without first unlocking the attribute somehow.

Attributes have initial values based on the type of entity something is, and can be raised further by spending [[XP]]. However, costs increase very quickly for increasing Attributes - the first point of increase costs 10xp, the second 40xp, the third 90xp, the fourth 160xp, and so on. Attributes are far more often temporarily boosted or permanently boosted through alterations of the nature of the self than they are 'trained up'. There is no inherent cap on Attributes in the system other than their rapidly increasing cost.

A character with zero or less in a given [[Attribute]] (temporary or otherwise) cannot perform actions dependent on that [[Attribute]]. 

Standard humans start with 4 in each [[Attribute]] except [[Fortune]], which starts at 0. [[Background]] and [[Layer]] templates, as well as particular [[Advantages]] can replace or modify these initial values.
### [[Pool]] 

Each Attribute also contributes to an associated resource Pool that is used to power actions involving any of the associated Attributes. The two Pools are [[Stamina]] and [[Focus]]. Supernatural 'extra' attributes will each contribute (and draw from) one of those two pools.
### [[Health]]

In Patina, characters do not have a hitpoint track per se, but rather accumulate temporary condition cards which each carry a Severity and a set of effects depending on their Severity. 

Repeated injuries of the same kind (e.g. duplicate cards) can upgrade the Severity of the card in the pattern that two cards of the same Severity combine to make one card with Severity+1, but when cards of different Severity combine only the larger value is retained. 

For **long-term conditions**, a Severity 1 condition goes away in a day, a Severity 2 condition becomes Severity 1 in a week, a Severity 3 condition becomes Severity 2 in a month, and a Severity 4 condition is permanent without medical intervention. 

For **short-term conditions**, Severity 1 lasts for ten seconds, Severity 2 lasts for a minute, Severity 3 lasts for ten minutes, and Severity 4 lasts for an hour.

In either case, characters may attempt to generate a [[Task]] to remove a specific condition card and progress towards that task accordingly, which can resolve the condition much more quickly than natural healing. This can either be in the form of external medical intervention, or internal biofeedback or resilience techniques. 

**Specifically in the case of internal techniques**: a character who manages to complete the Task in a single roll can shake off or reduce an incoming Condition before it has a chance to apply its consequences or debuffs.

**Unconsciousness and Death** - Even if no particular condition specifies unconsciousness, a character suffering enough debuffs to bring their [[Body]] or [[Mind]] to zero will be knocked unconscious as an additional condition - generally a **short-term condition** of Severity comparable to the damage source that caused it, but some damage sources (diseases and poisons generally) may specifically cause **long-term** unconsciousness if they manage to zero an attribute instead.

Death is either a specific consequence of a condition at a particular Severity (generally reserved for damage sources capable of complete destruction of a body, or for conditions created by  assassination techniques) or is the result of a [[Coup de Gras]] against an unconscious character.
### Retraining

Players may release non-Birth-only character options purchased with XP in order to reclaim that XP and spend it elsewhere. Doing so requires a day of downtime per point of XP released or for the GM to waive the retraining times (e.g. in the case of a rules change or misunderstanding, or if the things being retrained in particular should be easy to release).
