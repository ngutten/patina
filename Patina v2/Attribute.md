The core attributes are divided into Stamina and Focus attributes. A character's base Stamina and Focus pools are equal to the sum of the associated attributes. The attributes are:
#### [[Stamina]] Attributes
- [[Might]] - Raw physical strength. Determines how much a character can carry and lift, how much they can make a melee weapon penetrate armor.
- [[Body]] - Physical bulk, ability to sustain and resist physical damage, immune system
- [[Dexterity]] - Fine motor control, equilibrium and balance, precise movement, aim. Applies to the largest number of physical tasks. Directly contributes to Stealth pips.
- [[Reflexes]] - Speed, movement rate, initiative, dodging. Hard limit on whether a pre-emptive reaction can be taken against an opponent. Determines the ST to hit the character in combat.
#### [[Focus]] Attributes
- [[Intellect]] - Capacity for memory and processing, inference, logic, reasoning, and learning. 
- [[Mind]] - Willpower, resilience of mind, emotional stability, equanimity.
- [[Senses]] - Ability to perceive things about the world and the self, awareness of self vs environment, attention. Sight range, night vision, directly scales supernatural senses (auras, etc).
- [[Empathy]] - Ability to model others, sense and comprehend the emotions, motives, and plans of others, ability to sustain mental connections with other minds.

Additionally, characters may obtain special attributes due to supernatural origins or transformative events. These must first be unlocked, which provides 1 rank for free, but then can be bought up at the cost of `5 x New Rank^2` XP to a normal maximum of 5. Special attributes do not contribute to Stamina or Focus.
Some of these special attributes are:
- **[[Resonance]]** - The degree to which a character's spiritual nature aligns across multiple layers of reality, space, or time - a general attribute of those with the [[Shared Soul]] origin. A character's Resonance determines their capacity for drawing on traits, skills, conditions, and other aspects of their alternate souls.  This attribute is also developed by those who practice any sort of direct spiritual manipulations.
- **[[Destiny]]** - The characteristic attribute of the [[Destined]], this measures a character's importance to fate and destiny. This determines how much the character can deform chance and probability before it is simpler for whatever the character was needed for happening via alternate means - a finite line of credit offered by prophecy or the avoidance of paradox. 
- **[[Presence]]** - A characteristic attribute of [[Outsider|Outsiders]] - those who operate under different rules and who may bring their own rules with them to impose upon the function of the world. The usual manifestation is as an aura of intimidation or awe surrounding the person, but it also can just draw or even deflect attention. An [[Outsider]]'s Presence also determines their ability to change the rules of how things work, and the overall range and duration of that influence. Practitioners of [[Animism]] disciplines may sometimes be granted [[Presence]] by their patron entities as a special favor, but this is generally not required in order to use [[Animism]] powers or tasks. 
- **[[Enlightenment]]** - The characteristic attribute of [[Thoughtforms]], but also an attribute developed by those who practice manipulations of the [[Information Layer]], this represents the ability of the character's mind to apprehend and manipulate such a space and limits the complexity and directness of their manipulations. 

Starting player characters begin by assigning the following values to the basic Attributes, as the player desires: 5, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2. These may be further modified by [[Supernatural Origins]], [[Background]], and [[Advantage|Advantages]].
