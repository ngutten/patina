The core attributes are divided into Stamina and Focus attributes. A character's base Stamina and Focus pools are equal to the sum of the associated attributes. The attributes are:
#### [[Stamina]] Attributes
- [[Might]] - Raw physical strength. Determines how much a character can carry and lift, how much they can make a melee weapon penetrate armor.
- [[Body]] - Physical bulk, ability to sustain and resist physical damage, immune system
- [[Dexterity]] - Fine motor control, equilibrium and balance, precise movement, aim. Applies to the largest number of physical tasks. Directly contributes to Stealth pips.
- [[Reflexes]] - Speed, movement rate, initiative, dodging. Hard limit on whether a pre-emptive reaction can be taken against an opponent. Determines the ST to hit the character in combat.
#### [[Focus]] Attributes
- [[Intellect]] - Capacity for memory and processing, inference, logic, reasoning, and learning. 
- [[Mind]] - Willpower, resilience of mind, emotional stability, equanimity.
- [[Senses]] - Ability to perceive things about the world and the self, awareness of self vs environment, attention. Sight range, night vision, directly scales supernatural senses (auras, etc).
- [[Empathy]] - Ability to model others, sense and comprehend the emotions, motives, and plans of others, ability to sustain mental connections with other minds.

Additionally, characters may obtain special attributes due to supernatural origins or transformative events. These must first be unlocked, but then can be bought up normally. Special attributes do not contribute to Stamina or Focus.
Some of these are:
- [[Fortune]] - Attribute associated with importance in fate or destiny as well as supernatural luck. Applies to random things, but also things which explicitly manipulate or arrange the future. Able to modify GM luck rolls = 1d10 per rank.
- [[Presence]] - Indicates someone whose existence deforms the world if only a little. Usual manifestation is as an aura of intimidation or awe surrounding the person, but also can just draw or even deflect attention. When flared, inflicts an increase in ST equal to Presence of the defender minus Mind of the aggressor to any actions taken against the character.
- [[Sanguine]] - Attunement to the connection of all things through the blood. Attribute of those who can steal strength or forms from others, who can form and pull on connections through blood. 
- [[Oath]] - Attribute of those who bind themselves in order to hold higher authority over the world. Points of Oath require swearing and upholding oaths. In turn, the character's word becomes closer to absolute truth, others lose the ability to break their own oaths made to the character, and ultimately the world deforms to help the character uphold their promises.

Baseline human characters start with 3 in the core attributes and do not have any special attributes unlocked.
