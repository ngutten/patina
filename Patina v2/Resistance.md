Characters can have various sources of resistance, most frequently through their gear but sometimes through innate characteristics or effects placed upon them. Resistances are associated with particular categories (which need not be mutually exclusive), and have a numerical rating. The Severity of incoming [[Conditions]] is reduced by a character's [[Resistance]] minus any [[Penetration]] associated with the source.
