In Patina, non-trivial actions characters perform take the form of 'tasks'. Tasks each have a particular [[Success Threshold]] indicated `ST` that can depend on contextual factors. In order to complete the task, the character must achieve a total score at least equal to that threshold.

Note that in Patina, it is assumed that a character can reliably succeed at doing a thing they set out to do, if it is at all possible for that character to do that thing. What is not guaranteed is whether or not this will cost resources, come with complications or side-effects (see [[Risk Dice]]), or somehow be proactively countered by an action taken by someone or something else. **There is no roll to determine if a character fails to perform an action**. 

Tasks have an associated [[Attribute]] and (usually) also a [[Skill]] or [[Subskill]]. A character's score at a given task is equal to their [[Skill]] (or [[Subskill]]) plus any bonus from [[Talent]] plus additional bonus score purchased by spending points of the [[Pool]] associated with the task's [[Attribute]]. The total number of points of [[Pool]] that can be spent on a single task is limited by the character's corresponding [[Attribute]].

Bonus may normally be purchased in two forms:
- 1 point of [[Pool]] = +1 score
- 1 point of [[Pool]] = +2 score + 1 [[Risk Dice]]

For example, a character wishes to jump over a gap. The GM judges this to be an `ST 5` [[Dexterity]]/[[Athletics]] task. The character has 3 ranks of [[Athletics]], so they need to make up 2 ranks of score in order to perform the action successfully. They can choose to spend 2 [[Stamina]] and just jump the gap with no complications, or they could spend 1 [[Stamina]] and roll a [[Risk Dice]], or they could choose to abort the task.

In the case that a character has a [[Subskill]] that would be appropriate to a task that normally falls under one of the general [[Skill|Skills]], they gain half of their [[Subskill]] as an additional bonus. The consideration for this should be quite narrow.

[[SPECIALIZED]] tasks specifically **require** the character to have a certain rank of a [[Skill]] or [[Subskill]] to even attempt in the normal flow of events. However, characters can perform an [[Improvisation]] task to try to wing it given at least enough information and observation to understand the theory of the missing skill or subskill. The ST is based on how complete the player's comprehension is of how they are having the character figure it out. Even then, this process is slow and  takes at least 10 times as long as the action would normally take. Furthermore, the character rolls and additional number of [[Risk Dice]] equal to the ranks they are lacking.
