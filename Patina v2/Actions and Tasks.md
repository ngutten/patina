In Patina, non-trivial actions characters perform take the form of 'tasks'. Tasks each have a particular [[Success Threshold]] indicated `ST` that can depend on contextual factors. In order to complete the task, the character must achieve a total score at least equal to that threshold.

Note that in Patina, it is assumed that a character can reliably succeed at doing a thing they set out to do, if it is at all possible for that character to do that thing. What is not guaranteed is whether or not this will cost resources, come with complications or side-effects (see [[Risk Dice]]), or somehow be proactively countered by an action taken by someone or something else. **There is no roll to determine if a character fails to perform an action**. 

Tasks have an associated [[Attribute]], [[Skill]], and potentially [[Specialization]]. A character's score at a given task is equal to their [[Skill]] plus an additional bonus purchased by spending points of the [[Pool]] associated with the task's [[Attribute]]. If a [[Specialization]] applies, the rank of the [[Specialization]] is added as well. The total number of points of [[Pool]] that can be spent on a single task is limited by the character's corresponding [[Attribute]].

Bonus may normally be purchased in two forms:
- 1 point of [[Pool]] = +1 score
- 1 point of [[Pool]] = +2 score + 1 [[Risk Dice]]

For example, a character wishes to jump over a gap. The GM judges this to be an `ST 5` [[Dexterity]]/[[Athletics]] task. The character has 3 ranks of [[Athletics]] and no appropriate [[Specialization]], so they need to make up 2 ranks of score in order to perform the action successfully. They can choose to spend 2 [[Stamina]] and just jump the gap with no complications, or they could spend 1 [[Stamina]] and roll a [[Risk Dice]], or they could choose to abort the task.

[[<Specialized>]] tasks specifically **require** a given [[Specialization]] in order to be performed at all. Such tasks only gain the benefit of 1/2 of the character's ranks in the controlling [[Skill]]. Such actions can be discovered and refined by characters lacking the [[Specialization]], but this is considered part of the [[Experimentation]] task - on completion, the character would become eligible to purchase the necessary [[Specialization]] in order to perform the action reliably, but would not automatically be able to reproduce their success.
