In Patina, characters do not have a hitpoint track per se, but rather accumulate temporary condition cards which each carry a Severity and a set of effects depending on their Severity. 

Repeated injuries of the same kind (e.g. duplicate cards) can upgrade the Severity of the card in the pattern that two cards of the same Severity combine to make one card with Severity+1, but when cards of different Severity combine only the larger value is retained. 

For **long-term conditions**, a Severity 1 condition goes away in a day, a Severity 2 condition becomes Severity 1 in a week, a Severity 3 condition becomes Severity 2 in a month, and a Severity 4 condition is permanent without medical intervention. 

For **short-term conditions**, Severity 1 lasts for ten seconds, Severity 2 lasts for a minute, Severity 3 lasts for ten minutes, and Severity 4 lasts for an hour.

**Unconsciousness and Death** - Even if no particular condition specifies unconsciousness, a character suffering enough debuffs to bring their [[Body]] or [[Mind]] to zero will be knocked unconscious as an additional condition - generally a **short-term condition** of Severity comparable to the damage source that caused it, but some damage sources (diseases and poisons generally) may specifically cause **long-term** unconsciousness if they manage to zero an attribute instead.

Death is either a specific consequence of a condition at a particular Severity (generally reserved for damage sources capable of complete destruction of a body, or for conditions created by  assassination techniques) or is the result of a [[Coup de Gras]] against an unconscious character.
