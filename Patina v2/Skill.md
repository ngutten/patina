Skills are broad categories of competence and talent, rather than representing specific knowledge or training. A character could have a broad [[Machine Use]] skill rather than a specific skill for computers or driving cars or piloting aircraft.

Skills first and foremost act as prerequisites for being able to do certain things. Performing a certain surgery may be strictly impossible without a certain rank of [[Medicine]]. For [[Methods]] these prerequisite ranks are explicitly given; for improvised actions, it is adjudicated on the fly.

Skills also contribute to the dice rolls that determine progress towards completion of a Task, and as such can modify the time and expense of doing things. A practical example of this is that basic 'attacks' in melee combat are modeled as progression towards creating an opening to land a strike, and so the corresponding skill effectively determines the rate at which a character can land hits.

Characters start with zero in all skills, but gain free 'ghost' skill ranks from their [[Background]] (in that they do not increase the cost of buying more points of skill, and act to increase the effective skill cap). 

Skills can be advanced at a cost of 3xp for the first additional point, 6xp for the second, 9xp for the third, and so on. There is a normal cap of 5 points of skill purchases, though (independently of ghost ranks) this cap can be increased through specific [[Advantages]] or in-character opportunities. A character making a fundamental discovery in a field of science may gain the specific opportunity to break cap on their [[Science]] skill for example.
