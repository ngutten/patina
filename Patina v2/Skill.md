Skills represent fundamentals and broad categories of competence and talent, whereas [[Subskills]] represent specific knowledge and training in a narrow field. To this end, the general skills take the form of abstract categories of action - [[Aggression]], [[Invention]], [[Making]], and so on.

General skills cost 2xp times the new rank to raise and start at zero, though [[Background|Backgrounds]] can give free skill ranks as part of their packages.

The general skills are:

- [[Aggression]] - Warfare, attacking in combat, intimidation, showing spine.
- [[Awareness]] - Talent at noticing things in your surroundings, judging what is relevant and what is not, picking out details, searching, following tracks, sensing latent hostility, etc. 
- [[Communication]] - Understanding others and making yourself understood, making contact, skill at languages. Important in artistic practice. Also can cover leadership, revelry, commanding others so they can understand and execute the commands, etc.
- [[Creativity]] - Ability to un-stick one's thought process, and to bring new ideas into existence. Also part of artistic expression and expressing things which previously had no form. Invention, MacGyvering, etc also falls under this skill.
- [[Deception]] - Hiding your self or your intentions or your truths. Anything involving concealing evidence, preventing others from knowing things. Cryptography is under here, as are various forms of spycraft, stealth, etc.
- [[Destruction]] - As opposed to Aggression, this skill is centered on the ending of things and their function rather than the act of attacking. Sabotage, demolitions, making the biggest bombs, targeting cannonfire for the greatest damage to a structure, dismantling an organization. Talent at knowing how things can fall apart.
- [[Devices]] - Everything from driving a car to using a computer to picking a lock to playing an instrument. How comfortable you are with acting through something else, understanding the internal mechanisms of something else. 
- [[Esoterica]] - The ability to conceptualize things outside of the familiar, to move one's thoughts in alien patterns and to comprehend and abide paradoxes. The skill to believe in apparently false and contradictory things as if they were true, and in doing so being able to utilize them.
- [[Grit]] - The ability to bear stresses, pain, and injury. To work through negative things without being impacted. Holding one's breath, marching for hours in heavy gear and bad environmental conditions, holding still while undergoing surgery without anaesthetic.
- [[Grok]] - Making sense of the patterns of the world, the behaviors and thoughts of others. Understanding, comprehension. Various forms of natural science fall under here.
- [[Insight]] - Knowing the self, navigating one's own mind and body. Meditation, self-reflection.
- [[Instinct]] - Survival in nature, ability to listen to and execute primal drives and urges when appropriate or necessary, ability to act automatically and correctly without thought. Also covers reflexive self-protective actions - shielding from a blow or explosion, closing eyes against a bright flash, etc.
- [[Making]] - Talent at constructing, building, crafting, and designing things to order. The systematic flip side of [[Creativity]] - Creativity gets you ideas while Making helps you apply them. This is engineering to creativity's research.
- [[Movement]] - Climbing, running, swimming, acrobatics, dancing - control of the movement of your own body.
- [[Nurture]] - Making things whole, helping things achieve their best potential. Anything from repairing broken objects to treating wounds to teaching students to growing plants. Knowing what something needs in order to get better.
- [[Planning]] - The ability to conceptualize complex courses of action, map them out, and follow them. Knowing what you need to know. Designing systems - logistics, organizational systems, etc. Conceiving of how something will operate in mental simulation.
- [[Scholarship]] - Locating and organizing information, access to large amounts of formal knowledge, trace the provenance of knowledge (who said what, who came up with what, where do people disagree), find things in a library, test-taking skills, etc. Also covers applying formal systems of thought like logic or mathematics.
- [[Social]] - Understanding and manipulating the relationships between people and the dynamics of organizations larger than one person. Less applicable to a one-on-one conversation, more about understanding the pressures and reliances people have between each-other. Politics falls under here.
- [[Trade]] - Anything involving exchanges and understanding the relative values of things, from economics to sacrifice plays in board games to increasing the efficiency of your resource expenditures in a building project or in magic.
