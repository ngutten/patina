A full night's sleep has a number of beneficial effects for most characters. This is (usually) 8 hours, minus 1 hour per 2 ranks of [[Grit]] a character possesses.

- A full night's sleep fully restores a character's [[Stamina]] and [[Focus]]
- A **uninterrupted** full night's sleep removes one level of [[Fatigue]] from both [[Pool|Pools]], so long as they are not participating in an [[Extended Tasks|Extended Task]] associated with the corresponding [[Pool]].

Characters cannot benefit from multiple 'full night's sleep' in a given 24 period. Characters who do not need to sleep gain these benefits once every 24 hours.

Failure to obtain a full night's sleep has scaling penalties. For each hour of deficit, a character's maximum [[Pool|Pools]] are reduced by 1. This is **cumulative** across multiple days until a full night's sleep is successfully obtained, which erases the entire penalty.

If a character's sleep is interrupted - not just tossing and turning, but the character needing to become fully awake for some reason - this prevents it from removing [[Fatigue]] but all other effects of sleep are preserved according to the total cumulative hours of sleep the character has obtained. 

Bad quality sleep may increase the number of hours needed in order to make up a full night depending on the conditions (excessive heat or cold, awkward sleeping arrangements, noise, etc). This will be communicated as e.g. +1 hour, +2 hours, +3 hours needed. A character may perform a [[Grit]]([[Mind]]) task with `ST 3 x Hours` to simply ignore the bad circumstances and sleep on.

The durations of long-term [[Health and Injury|Conditions]] tick down regardless of whether a character has managed to sleep or not.
