This subsystem is used for heists, scouting, confidence scams, or other situations in which a group of characters is trying to operate while avoiding detection from the people or organizations in control of an area - hereafter referred to as the Adversary.

The basic structure of Infiltration is that characters have pools based on their [[Deception]] subskills which can be spent to guarantee that an action or movement will go undetected, with costs based on the highest [[Perception]] out of any guards or observers or investigators from whom the action is to be hidden. 

Characters may still attempt stealthy actions even without the appropriate subskills, but doing so increases the [[Exposure]] of the party to the Adversary - this is how much information their adversaries have on their operations, which limits the sorts of actions that can be taken against the characters or defensive changes that can be made to make infiltration harder.

| Exposure Level | Description                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0              | Adversary is unaware that anything abnormal is going on, and can only take general security precautions appropriate to the venue.                  |
| 1              | Evidence that something anomalous is going on, but no specific evidence of enemy action.                                                           |
| 2              | Evidence that hostile or intentional infiltration took place or might be on-going.                                                                 |
| 3              | Infiltrators or their direct actions have been spotted but not necessarily identified. A guard sees someone darting through a door, etc.           |
| 4              | Some infiltrators have been directly observed or uncovered.                                                                                        |
| 5              | The Infiltrators have been discovered in detail (identities, current locations, etc), and evidence linking them to their actions has been secured. |
Exposure is not additive, but acts more like a ratchet - a worse Exposure replaces a more mild one, but also Exposure can immediately jump to the highest value from zero if the Infiltrators are totally unmasked somehow. Certain things automatically increase Exposure regardless of the characters' stealth - a guard failing to report in at minimum increases Exposure to 1 and a second event at minimum raises it to 2; an object under protection disappearing raises Exposure to a minimum of 3, etc.

The [[Exposure]] level automatically adds to the effective [[Perception]] skill of guards for the purpose of determining costs and STs. Once Exposure hits 5, characters may no longer spend from Infiltration-associated pools to automatically avoid detection tests.

Exposure is generally tied to a specific Adversary. A thief for example would have a certain level of [[Exposure]] to the security forces at a particular venue, but this would be different than their [[Exposure]] to a detective who has been hunting them for years. When adversaries combine forces and share information, the higher [[Exposure]] level is retained. 

Meanwhile, a character's [[Deception]] pools are tied to a specific Venue - this can be as narrow as 'this warehouse, tonight' or as broad as 'the court of the king of France', but basically covers a set of connected deceptions.
