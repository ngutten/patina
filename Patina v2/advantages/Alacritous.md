**Cost**: 12xp
**Prerequisites**: Dexterity 5

This character can perform tasks involving manual dexterity much more quickly than normal. When beneficial: Dexterity tasks with an Interval between 1-3 rounds (10-30 seconds) only take this character 1 round, Dexterity tasks with an Interval of 4-6 rounds only take 2 rounds, and Dexterity tasks with an Interval of 7-10 rounds only take 3 rounds.

Furthermore, more leeway is given when combining 1 round Dexterity tasks (such as [[Attack with Weapon|attacking with a weapon]]) with other non-task motions.
