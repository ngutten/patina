Two types of things may allow a character to reduce the Severity of incoming status conditions before they apply. 
#### [[Resistance]]

Characters may be specially resistant against particular sources of injury or status condition. [[Armor]] for example counts as a source of [[Resistance]] against physical injuries. Similarly, sources of status conditions and injuries have a [[Penetration]] rating which is the amount of [[Resistance]] that they ignore before applying their effect at its baseline Severity. Any [[Resistance]] remaining over this value reduces the Severity of the incoming effect by 1 point each.
#### Shedding Severity

Characters with appropriate [[Specialization|Specializations]] may have access to tasks that allow them to shed negative conditions or to prevent them from landing. 

**Reduce Injury** [[<Instantaneous>]] [[<Automatic>]] [[<Reaction>]] [[{Resilience}]]: All characters may reflexively reduce the severity of incoming physical injuries as an [[Endurance]]-based task or mental injuries as a [[Willpower]]-based task at `ST 6 + 4C` to reduce the Severity of an incoming condition by 1. The [[Cumulative Difficulty]] resets upon the character receiving one hour of rest. This Task does not apply to all conditions, only specifically ones that take the form of damage to body or mind. There is no particular skill associated with this Task by default, though [[Advantage|Advantages]] and particular [[Specialization|Specializations]] may change that.

**Shake Off** [[<Automatic>]] [[{Recovery}]]: All characters may partially shake off mental controls or influences with a [[Willpower]]-based task at `ST 6 + 2*Severity + 4C`, reducing the Severity of the associated condition by 1. The [[Cumulative Difficulty]] resets upon the character receiving a day of rest. There is no particular skill associated with this Task by default, though [[Advantage|Advantages]] and particular [[Specialization|Specializations]] may change that.
