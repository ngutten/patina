This keyword indicates that a given Task can be undertaken to recover from a condition that would otherwise prevent a character from acting or initiating tasks. E.g. even an unconscious character could attempt a [[RECOVERY]] task to regain consciousness. These tasks may still require the character to commit an interval of time to them, so e.g. a character cannot simultaneously undertake three different [[RECOVERY]] tasks on three separate conditions unless those tasks are also [[AUTOMATIC]] or [[INSTANTANEOUS]].
