Common Subskills:
[[Chase]] - Specific training with regards to chasing people and escaping from being chased, above and beyond speed and navigation ability. 
[[Sprinting]] - Boost your movement speed in all things, complete physical movements more quickly possibly in exchange for [[Stamina]].
[[Parkour]] - Move through cluttered environments effortlessly, ignore difficulty terrain, compose multiple movements into a single check, avoid damage from falls or collisions.
[[Sport]] - Any particular formal organized sport has a dedicated subskill. Mostly here for the +1/2 rank bonus, the do not tend to give particular perks. 

Example Subskills requiring special training:
[[Dynamic Augmentation]] - Incorporate force projection and transmission into your movements. Either involves the use of [[Dynamic Relays]] or also requires [[Telekinesis]] via Psionics.
[[Qi Breathing]] - Particular cyclical breathing style with methods that enable Stamina regeneration when it should be blocked and ways of resetting physical Cumulative Difficulties. May or may not have supernatural aspects - seems like anyone can learn it, but its not widely taught.
[[Flight]] - Specifically for those with personal-scale flight or gliding tied to muscle movement, as opposed to flight via a device. For fancy reflexive flying maneuvers, mid-air dodges and redirections, etc.
[[Morphic Adaptation]] - Subskill that assists with any practice that changes someone's body, from extreme prosthetics to shapeshifting. How quickly and readily can you become at home in a new body and adapt to using its particular advantages?
