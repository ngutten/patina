This is the general skill for the creation of items and objects. A character is assumed to be practicing a particular Craft, not just 'Crafting' in general - blacksmithing, woodworking, ship-building, pottery, clockwork, etc. Characters with Craft can still apply it to fields they are not practiced in, but at a -5 penalty. This penalty can be reduced and ultimately eliminated through dedicating passive [[Downtime]] to practice. Some [[Background|Backgrounds]] may grant additional free crafting categories on top of the one represented by any XP investiture.

The ST and time to perform Crafting tasks is highly modular, depending on what specifically a character is trying to make. As such, rather than a list of tasks (and a further list for each subskill), there are general rules of thumb:

- Crafting generally uses [[Dexterity]]. In some cases it might use [[Intellect]] instead, where the actual manipulation of materials is being done indirectly through large-scale configurable machinery (for example, making the hulls of ships or using an industrial-sized drop hammer to shape pieces of metal multiple meters in size).

- An interval of Crafting generally corresponds to a 4 hour block of work. Crafting tasks are generally [[INTERRUPTIBLE]].

- Basic Crafting tasks at commercially available levels of skill tend to have a base ST around 5 - making a rowboat, a horseshoe, making a glass cup, drawing a portrait accurately, etc. Professionals are assumed to generally be spending [[Stamina]] and [[Focus]] at their job!

- For hand-scale work, one Interval is sufficient to make common objects about 10cm in linear dimension - to knit or weave a patch of cloth, forge a knife, carve a statuette, etc. If the individual pieces involved can be scaled (e.g. no fine detail is essential to the craft) then there is a 10x scale multiplier. Machines can provide further, significantly larger multipliers. 

Beyond that, see [[Crafting]] for ways in which particular crafts can be designed, and ways in which the actual crafting process may be modified.

In addition to common crafts, there are esoteric forms which require particular [[Subskill|Subskills]]. Generally these **replace** [[Craft]], rather than only acting as pre-requisites, but the particulars of a given project matter here - a more modular project may be split into separate tasks, or one with complex interdependencies between multiple skills might use the lowest rank out of all skills.

Example Subskills requiring special training:
[[Runecarving]] - Shamanistic practice connecting objects to sponsoring [[Entity|Entities]]
[[Dyna-forging]] - Subdiscipline of [[Dynamics]]
[[Tapestry]] - Subdiscipline of [[Fateweaving]], involving the specification of widescale future patterns rather than individual events.
