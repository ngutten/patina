A general talent for crafting isn't enough for someone to know how to blow glass into a spiral or what the proper carbon content of hard steel should be. Because of this, Craft tends to almost entirely be about the subskills, while the general skill covers very broad 'tinkering' types of uses. Common craft subskills involve the specialized techniques needed to work with specific materials. 

The ST and time to perform Crafting tasks is highly modular, depending on what specifically a character is trying to make. As such, rather than a list of tasks (and a further list for each subskill), there are general rules of thumb:

- Crafting generally uses [[Dexterity]]. In some cases it might use [[Intellect]] instead, where the actual manipulation of materials is being done indirectly through large-scale configurable machinery (for example, making the hulls of ships or using an industrial-sized drop hammer to shape pieces of metal multiple meters in size).

- An interval of Crafting generally corresponds to a 4 hour block of work. Crafting tasks are generally [[{Interruptible}]].

- Basic Crafting tasks at commercially available levels of skill tend to have a base ST around 5 - making a rowboat, a horseshoe, making a glass cup, drawing a portrait accurately, etc. 

- For hand-scale work, one Interval is sufficient to make common objects about 10cm in linear dimension - to knit or weave a patch of cloth, forge a knife, carve a statuette, etc. If the individual pieces involved can be scaled (e.g. no fine detail is essential to the craft) then there is a 10x scale multiplier. Machines can provide further, significantly larger multipliers. 

Beyond that, see [[Crafting]] for ways in which particular crafts can be designed, and ways in which the actual crafting process may be modified.

Common Subskills:

[[Blacksmithing]] - Specific techniques for working and shaping metal, devising alloys, etc
[[Woodworking]] - Specific techniques for shaping and joining wood, mostly for furniture but some construction work as well.
[[Clothier]] - Weaving, knitting, stitching, connecting fabrics, with a focus on clothing (but also applicable to other clothwork like sails, awnings, etc)
[[Glaziery]] - Working and shaping glass or glass-like materials - making specific shaped vessels via glassblowing, making flat panes, artistic techniques such as canework or sculpture, etc.
[[Painting]] - Applying pigment to 2d media in order to capture or create novel images. This is the technical side of things, while [[Aesthetics]] is design and conceptualization. Also covers sketching, sand art, etc.
[[Shipbuilding]] - Specific techniques for creating naval vessels
[[Clockwork]] - Specific techniques for assembling miniaturized mechanisms
[[Gemcutting]] - Cutting and shaping stones to draw out their brilliance

Example Subskills requiring special training:
[[Runecarving]] - Shamanistic practice connecting objects to sponsoring [[Entity|Entities]]
[[Dyna-forging]] - Subdiscipline of [[Dynamics]]
[[Tapestry]] - Subdiscipline of [[Fateweaving]], involving the specification of widescale future patterns rather than individual events.
