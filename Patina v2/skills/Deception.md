Deception covers any situation in which one needs to limit the information others obtain or create false perceptions or impressions. Acting, masking one's emotions, and lying are straightforward applications, but this skill is also the general skill under which things like stealth and concealment take place. 

The rank a character has in Deception and its subskills interacts strongly with the [[Infiltration]] subsystem above and beyond actual tasks and checks. 

**Rank 1**: The character has become at a basic level 'comfortable' with lying. They no longer overtly stammer or hesitate when saying brief lies, though they may still get confused and have to think about things which should be instant or add unnecessary details. The character can 'act natural'.

**Rank 2**: The character's deceptions become more streamlined - when lying they try to avoid details and leave themselves wiggle room, so their overall web of lies becomes unmanageable less quickly. This is the minimum rank for a character to feasibly play an extended role as someone other than themselves, though they will still struggle with affectations, accents, cultural variations, and the like.

**Rank 3**: At this rank, the character has learned to observe others and accurately imitate their accents, gait, posture, and mannerisms. Furthermore, the character has learned to compartmentalize their role - with some effort they can believably think through and portray even beliefs they strongly disagree with.

**Rank 4**: The character becomes more aware of the awareness of others. They gain a sixth sense as to when they're being observed, as well as when someone is suspicious of them and may be probing their disguise or role. With effort, the character learns to deflect suspicion onto others temporarily.

**Rank 5**: The character has reached a point where they can start to think not just about what they want others to believe of them, but what they want others to *do* because of that belief. This is the minimum rank of anyone who expects to be a successful con-man. The character may, with effort, workshop with the GM to figure out how people will respond to their lies and design certain broad classes of con - how to hook someone, how to brush someone off, etc. This does not allow manipulation in detail, just in broad movements.

**Rank 6**: With effort the character can maintain multiple seemingly incompatible deceptions at the same time, even when the subjects of those deceptions are interacting with the character simultaneously. The more complex the character's web of lies, the more focus this will take.

**Rank 7**: The character becomes able to construct and manipulate coincidences to suppress the abilities of others to be suspicious of them for a time. 

**Rank 8**:  At this rank, the character can, with time to prepare, imitate nearly any specific details of another human (and with effort, possibly some non-humans and objects) - voice, face, body type, etc can all be accurately copied.

**Rank 9**: 

**Rank 10**: The character has learned to transcend the limits of their own knowledge and skill when it comes to selling a lie or a role - they can, with effort, emulate skills or even minor supernatural abilities that they otherwise do not possess specifically for the purpose of the lie. The actual effects of this are themselves inevitably false in some way as well, though this may be established retroactively at the table (e.g. to sell being a surgeon, the person they're performing surgery on for the demo is -retroactively- a fresh cadaver stolen from the morgue for the purpose, or things like that). Furthermore, sometimes the character is just strangely lucky when it comes to things like passwords or
