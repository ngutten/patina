The skill associated with aggressive actions, attacks, warfare in general, arguing against someone, and so on. Warfare also covers things like soldiery, military strategy, ruling a country through military might,  hunting, and the practical aspects of conquest.
 
 A character with Warfare is assumed to be trained in a particular category of weapon or form of fighting - swordfighting, brawling, shooting, etc 'for free'. A character using a weapon they lack the category for suffers a -5 penalty. Additional categories can be added via expenditure of [[Downtime]] (or via a character's [[Background]]). 

Some weapons are specialized enough they require their own [[Subskill]], notably the use of artillery and mortars.

Example Tasks:
- [[Attack with Weapon]] (Dexterity/Warfare)
- [[Coup de Gras]] (Dexterity/Warfare)]
- [[Lead Charge]] (Reflexes/Warfare)
- [[Intimidate]] (Empathy/Warfare)
- [[Shove]] (Might/Warfare)
- [[Shout Down]] (Body/Warfare)


There are also particular fighting styles which add options beyond just 'stick the pointy end in the other guy' - these correspond to [[Subskill|Subskills]] that act as added prerequisites for particular moves which still use the base [[Warfare]] skill for their checks.

Some specialized forms of combat training are:
- [[Croquère Duelling Style]]
- [[Carok]]
- [[Iaijutsu]]
- [[Holmgang]]
- [[Fechtbücher]]
