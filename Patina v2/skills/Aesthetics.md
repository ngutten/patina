| 2       | [[Intellect]]                 | 1m       | Infer the cultural purposes of a structure or space, or the use of a tool, from its design. Some overlap with [[Esoterica]] and [[Craft]], focusing on different aspects of 'use'. ST is increased by 1 for very different culture (ancient, disconnected) or 2-4 for non-human psychologies. |
| 3       | [[Intellect]]                 | 10m      | Accurately transcribe a mental image, memory, or song                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 5       | [[Empathy]]                   | 1hr      | Depict an emotion in another medium, such that others experience it from the medium                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 6       | [[Senses]], [[INSTANTANEOUS]] | Inst.    | Interpret alien sensations or spaces in metaphor - more 'navigate dreamscapes' than 'find the bathroom in this architecture'                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 7       | [[Empathy]]                   | 1hr      | Depict an abstract concept in another medium, such that others can understand it                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 9       | [[Mind]], [[INSTANTANEOUS]]   | Inst.    | Adopt an alien mindset, interact with the world through an alien perspective (e.g. to defend against telepathy)                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 13 (5I) | [[Empathy]]                   | 8hr      | Compose an artistic work so profound that it deeply disturbs, enlightens, changes, or potentially maddens people - not to the level of a controllable mental attack (see [[Memetics]]) but a 'normal' revolutionary artistic work.                                                            |

Aesthetics covers an understanding of culture and aesthetics, as well as its intentional application to works. This can cover criticism, appreciation, decoration, an understanding of alternative media, and general awareness of the different kinds of artistry out there.

A character invested in Aesthetics is assumed to a particular expressive form that they practice 'for free' - a particular musical instrument, painting, photography, writing, etc. They may receive additional expressive forms through their [[Background]]. A character may still use a form they have not practiced, but at a -5 penalty. This penalty can be reduced and ultimately eliminated as part of passive use of [[Downtime]].

Appreciation - On the surface, make observations about another artist's work and motives. The hidden usage is to be able to feel things more or less deeply by choosing to immerse yourself into the aesthetics of experience. Cry on demand by understanding the aspects of your memories that best exemplify sadness, find joy in an otherwise sad moment, etc. Gain more benefits from revelry or celebration.
Decoration - Express things by decorating environments, objects, or people. Provide comfort, emotional regulation within those spaces, make spaces feel hostile or inviting or confusing. Increase the perceived value of objects you make, or change the class they're targeted at.
Medium - Use non-traditional forms to express yourself. Communicate anger in the movement of a crowd, or loss in a set of instructions for sorting trash. Lets you hide Aesthetic effects in strange places.
Music - Exert influence through song; non-supernatural bardic 'powers'.
