| 6       | [[Senses]], [[<Instantaneous>]] | Inst.    | Interpret alien sensations or spaces in metaphor - more 'navigate dreamscapes' than 'find the bathroom in this architecture'                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 13 (5I) | [[Empathy]]                     | 8hr      | Compose an artistic work so profound that it deeply disturbs, enlightens, changes, or potentially maddens people - not to the level of a controllable mental attack (see [[Memetics]]) but a 'normal' revolutionary artistic work.                                                            |


Common Subskills:

[[Appreciation]] - On the surface, make observations about another artist's work and motives. The hidden usage is to be able to feel things more or less deeply by choosing to immerse yourself into the aesthetics of experience. Cry on demand by understanding the aspects of your memories that best exemplify sadness, find joy in an otherwise sad moment, etc. Gain more benefits from revelry or celebration.
[[Decoration]] - Express things by decorating environments, objects, or people. Provide comfort, emotional regulation within those spaces, make spaces feel hostile or inviting or confusing. Increase the perceived value of objects you make, or change the class they're targeted at.
[[Medium]] - Use non-traditional forms to express yourself. Communicate anger in the movement of a crowd, or loss in a set of instructions for sorting trash. Lets you hide Aesthetic effects in strange places.
[[Music]] - Exert influence through song; non-supernatural bardic 'powers'.
