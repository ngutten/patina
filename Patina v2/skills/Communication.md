| 3 (8I)   | [[Intellect]] | 1 week   | Learn a new language at a conversational level via immersion. +1 ST to do this from written works and their translations or +3 ST to do it from written materials with no translation reference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 3        | [[Empathy]]   | 1hr      | Get non-secret information from locals in a town or city - directions, businesses, general lay of the land. Interval is shorter for more directed questions. +2 ST if the place is hostile, +1 ST to do this unobtrusively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 4        | [[Empathy]]   | Inst.    | Transmit a hidden message to a specific receiver you know in a broader conversation, or receive it as the intended receiver.  Detecting and interpreting it as an unintended receiver is +4 ST harder. You can voluntarily raise the ST, but it also raises it for the intended receiver.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Variable | [[Intellect]] | 1 day    | Create and crack ciphers. The ST to break a cipher is 6 higher than the ST to create it, but reduces by 1 for each additional document using the same cipher. One-time pads are immune to this barring supernatural abilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Variable | [[Empathy]]   | 10m      | Cast aspersions or glory on someone for nonspecific third parties present. Could be spreading a rumor, testifying for someone at court, etc. The ST for the other person to counter the allegations and repair their reputation (or the ST for people to see past the BS) is equal to the ST you choose plus or minus evidentiary and existing reputational factors.                                                                                                                                   |
| 6 (1+ I) | [[Empathy]]   | 1 month  | Establish a particular reputation for yourself somewhere - trustworthy, criminal, mysterious, foreign, etc. This acts as a proactive defense against others changing it if done in advance, making attacking your reputation +1 ST harder +1 ST for every additional year you passively sustain the reputation or per additional interval you extend the task, up to a maximum total defense of your Communication skill + 1. Decays by 1 ST every three months you are out of contact with the place. |

Example Subskills requiring special training:
[[Telepathy]] - Subdiscipline of [[Psionics]]
[[Invocation]] - Subdiscipline of [[Animism]], directly calling a particular [[Entity]], making contact, and negotiating. Sometimes used (by mistake) by mediums for seances, thinking they are contacting the dead.
