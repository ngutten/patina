The skill associated with talking with others, expressing yourself, making connections. Also leadership - giving commands, evoking loyalty, even allowing subordinates to use your skills.

**Rank 1**: This character has begun to consider intentionally how they communicate with others. A character with this much skill can easily use gestures and exaggerated body language to communicate simple ideas with other people. This rank is a minimum prerequisite for using nonverbal languages such as thieves' gestures, military gestures, sign language, and the like.

**Rank 2**: This character is aware of how others see them and can lean into or away from that, enabling them to comfortably open conversations with neutral or friendly strangers. If there is some hostility or xenophobia, this requires them to spend some effort but is still within the scope of their skills.

**Rank 3**: The character is aware of how the things they say are received by others and with some effort can adjust the course of a conversation, covering over awkwardness or walking back things which were said. If they push themselves, they can even cover for others. Furthermore, with effort this character can intentionally take charge of their public image or that of others, gradually (over a period of months) establishing themselves as associated with a particular business sector, opportunity, political position, etc such that strangers are likely to be aware of them.

**Rank 4**: The character has gotten into some of the more esoteric and academic aspects of how people communicate with each-other. At this rank it becomes possible for the character to decode the communications of others without reference to translations, as long as those communications have not been actively obfuscated. The character can, with significant time and effort, decode an otherwise untranslated language. 

This also extends to figuring out the tells and microexpressions of others, including non-human others - the character passively gets additional information when observing people, animals, supernatural beings, and the like suggestive of their mood, level of attention, and broad direction of intended action.

**Rank 5**: The character's theoretical understanding of communication deepens, allowing them to create and crack ciphers - the amount of effort and time required depending on the strength of the cipher in both directions, though this is asymmetrical and one-time pads are immune to this. 

**Rank 6**: The character can easily come up with ways to express things such that different people understand them differently - this depends on a level of knowledge about the intended recipient. They can also pick up on these things even when they're not the intended target. They can make an innocent comment sound seductive to one person, or phrase an offer for a bribe so that it can be made in front of someone's commanding officer without getting them in trouble if they accept.

**Rank 7**: The character's understanding of communication extends to group dynamics. What sort of messages are people receptive to and how will those messages spread? With variable amounts of effort, the character can put a spin on stories or events in order to control how they will be received by large groups of people - playing up a military massacre as a glorious hero making a difficult and regrettable decision, etc.

**Rank 8**: The character is intricately aware of the effects of context, personality, and norms - they can easily tell if something they are about to say would be offensive, ingratiating, etc. With effort they can figure out if there are ways to rephrase their message to avoid these landmines, or different contexts in which the message would be better received. In comparison to Rank 6, this usage does not require any particular pre-existing knowledge about the target of the communication and allows the player to directly get GM assistance in how to phrase things for an intended impact, as well as information about why it might or might not work. 

**Rank 9**: The character can craft messages and entire linguistic frameworks which are difficult to misinterpret or misunderstand (or the reverse if they like). At this rank, the character could intuitively know how to design a programming language, a representation of mathematics, a legal language that prevents loopholes, or a spoken language with exactly their intended level of ambiguity. Messages crafted this way are unusually easy for others to figure out - with extreme effort, the character can essentially lower the skill requirements of others to decode the languages they create.

**Rank 10**: The character's understanding of others is transcendent. Even without a shared language or even shared species, they can readily communicate somewhat complex concepts and understand the intentions of other entities. Furthermore, they become able to be directly aware of forms of communication which they are not naturally able to use - they can sense when there is a message hidden in a pattern of smells and can interpret indirect clues to tell when others are using telepathic communication. A character at this level can understand someone's emotions from a game of chess, or figure out the name of someone's fiancee via cold reading.

Interval is shorter for more directed questions. +2 ST if the place is hostile, +1 ST to do this unobtrusively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Detecting and interpreting it as an unintended receiver is +4 ST harder. You can voluntarily raise the ST, but it also raises it for the intended receiver.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Variable | [[Intellect]] | 1 day    | Create and crack ciphers. The ST to break a cipher is 6 higher than the ST to create it, but reduces by 1 for each additional document using the same cipher. One-time pads are immune to this barring supernatural abilities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Variable | [[Empathy]]   | 10m      | Cast aspersions or glory on someone for nonspecific third parties present. Could be spreading a rumor, testifying for someone at court, etc. The ST for the other person to counter the allegations and repair their reputation (or the ST for people to see past the BS) is equal to the ST you choose plus or minus evidentiary and existing reputational factors.                                                                                                                                   |
| 6 (1+ I) | [[Empathy]]   | 1 month  | Establish a particular reputation for yourself somewhere - trustworthy, criminal, mysterious, foreign, etc. This acts as a proactive defense against others changing it if done in advance, making attacking your reputation +1 ST harder +1 ST for every additional year you passively sustain the reputation or per additional interval you extend the task, up to a maximum total defense of your Communication skill + 1. Decays by 1 ST every three months you are out of contact with the place. |

Example Subskills requiring special training:
[[Telepathy]] - Subdiscipline of [[Psionics]]
[[Invocation]] - Subdiscipline of [[Animism]], directly calling a particular [[Entity]], making contact, and negotiating. Sometimes used (by mistake) by mediums for seances, thinking they are contacting the dead.
