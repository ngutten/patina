The basic unit of action in Patina beyond things which can just be done automatically is the Task. A Task has a Threshold for completion (a total number of successes that must be rolled) and a Cost per roll (which is generally the time it takes, but may also involve materials, supplies, points of Pools, risk of discovery, etc).

Characters may roll a number of d10s up to the controlling Skill associated with the Task each time they pay the Cost and may spend a point of the associated [[Pool]] per extra d10 to add up to the associated Attribute in extra dice to the roll. Dice showing 7, 8, 9, or 10 are successes, which accumulate against the Threshold of the task. Once a sufficient number of successes have been rolled, the Task is completed.

Dice showing 1s indicate Complications, which can either be bought off by spending points of the associated [[Pool]] or just accepted. Complications are GM-determined, but are intended to be 'yes, but' types of things - they should not negate the change that a character was trying to create by initiating the Task in the first place, though they may (should) add other things which need to be addressed in order for the character to be satisfied with the ultimate result. Complications **can** be things that make success conditional, or things **about** what success can mean in a given situation.

For example, a character is building a bridge and rolls a Complication. The GM offers 'you can build the bridge, but you need to temporarily dam the river upstream during part of the construction'. 

A character can abort a Task at any time, but any Complications that have not been bought off still apply to the extent that it makes sense.

In the previous example of the bridge, if the character chose to abort upon hearing that Complication, any future attempts by that character to build that bridge in the same way would still require damming the river, and in general the complication has established something about the building site being difficult to work with when the river is flowing. 

If the character had bought off the Complication with Focus and but then later aborted for some reason, then future attempts would **not** need to dam the river.

Finally, in a case where the Complication only makes sense upon completion, then aborting a Task can avoid the Complication entirely. If for example a character is casting a spell and the Complication is 'you will lose control of the targeting' then choosing to stop casting will prevent that Complication from applying, and the Complication will not apply the next time the character casts the spell either.
##### Compound Tasks

Methods can chain together into larger Tasks - for example, making a sword, adding a venom reservoir, then rustproofing the entire thing. In this case, Complications can broadcast across other parts of the overall process (e.g. a Complication of the initial forging of a sword could be that the intended addition of a venom reservoir with a separate Method becomes more difficult). Methods may explicitly indicate that they can or cannot chain this way.
##### Improvised Acts

With high Skill but no specific training, a character may attempt to wing various things that fall under the scope of their Skill in the form of Improvised Acts. The main differences between Improvised Acts and normal Tasks are:
- A character cannot spend points of [[Pool]] to buy off Complications (they may still spend points to add extra dice however)
- There is a maximum number of rolls that a character can take before the Improvised Act simply fails
- The Cost, Threshold, and Skill prerequisites are not fixed (or known in advance) and can decrease the more the character understands exactly how the Improvised Act could work (through experimentation, seeing other people perform it, coherent conceptualization of the process, etc)

Essentially what this comes down to is that an Improvised Act has no guarantees - no guarantee of eventual success, that success is even possible, or even of knowing the difficulty of success. 

Once a character has succeeded even once on a particular Improvised Act, they may choose to purchase it as a [[Method]]. The success Threshold of the resulting [[Method]] is based on the Threshold for the Improvised Act at which the character succeeded - getting the threshold lower before learning it as a Method can mean a more efficient Method.

A character can try to refine a Method they have invented by retrying the action as an Improvised Act after further developing their understanding. For Methods the character invented, this induces no additional xp cost. 

In order to improve on a Method they learned from someone else, the character must effectively try it as an Improvised Act and pay the cost to re-invent the Method from scratch (after which it is their own, and they can improve it for free). The success threshold may well start higher if the character's understanding of the fundamentals is weaker than that of the original inventor of the Method.
