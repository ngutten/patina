Character becomes more vulnerable to attacks, reducing the `ST` to hit them by 1 per Severity, and the `ST` to affect them with movement maneuvers by 2 per Severity.

At Severity 2+, the character may not use [[{Evasion}]] actions to avoid attacks or effects.

Off-balance of any Severity can be completely cleared by spending 10 seconds taking no other action other than regaining balance. Otherwise, it recovers as per a **short-term condition**.
