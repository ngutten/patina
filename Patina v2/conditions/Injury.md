This refers to multiple separate conditions, depending on where the Injury occurs. All Injuries reduce [[Body]] by 1 per Severity, but Arm and Leg Injuries are capped at -1 [[Body]] for each limb (although they will have other consequences). Torso and Head injuries scale indefinitely. 

Injuries are **long-term conditions**.
### Arm Injury
Increases the `ST` of tasks using that arm or hand by `2*Severity`. At Severity 3+, the arm cannot be used. 

At Severity 4+, the arm is lost and prosthetics or regenerative abilities are needed to restore it - the [[Body]] penalty is removed after 24 hours in this case. 
### Leg Injury
Reduces movement speed by 20% per Severity if the character relies on this limb to move (winged creatures can have Wing Injury, etc). This penalty is additive across both legs, so a net Severity of 5 means the character cannot walk at all.

Additionally, increases the `ST` of tasks using this limb by `2*Severity`, additive across both legs for tasks such as jumping.

At Severity 4+, the leg is lost and the [[Body]] penalty goes away after 24 hours.
### Head Injury
Risks inflicting [[Unconsciousness]] directly at equal Severity to this condition whenever the condition is first applied or upgraded. A [[Body]]/[[Grit]] check at `ST 3*Severity` avoids this.

Additionally, increases the `ST` of Focus-based tasks by `2*Severity`, and inflicts -1 [[Mind]] per Severity in addition to the [[Body]] penalty.

### Torso Injury
