The character has a bleeding wound which only gets worse with time. This is normally a **short-term** condition. However, whenever Bleed is untreated, when its duration is up then instead of reducing in Severity it will instead increase in Severity unless the character performs an `ST 2 + 2*Severity` [[Body]]/[[Grit]] task.

Treating Bleed is an ST `2+2*Severity` [[Dexterity]]/[[Medicine]] task.

Severity effects are additive:

Severity 1: +1 [[Cumulative Difficulty]] cost to all physical tasks until the Bleed is healed.
Severity 2: -1 [[Body]]
Severity 3: +1 [[Cumulative Difficulty]] cost to all physical tasks until the Bleed is healed.
Severity 4+: -1 [[Body]]

For example, normally attacking with a weapon has no [[Cumulative Difficulty]]. But at Bleed 1, every subsequent attack would be `+1 ST`. This would not increase the difficulty of a different physical skill however.
