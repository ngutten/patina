The character has a bleeding wound which only gets worse with time. This is normally a **short-term** condition. However, whenever Bleed is untreated, when its duration is up then instead of reducing in Severity it will instead increase in Severity unless the character performs an `ST 2 + 2*Severity` raw [[Body]] task ([[Grit]] subskill applies if available).

Treating Bleed is an ST `2+2*Severity` [[Dexterity]]/[[Medicine]] task.

Severity effects: -1 [[Body]] per rank of Severity.
