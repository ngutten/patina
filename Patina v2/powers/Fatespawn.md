Those with the forture or misfortune to, in some possible future, stand at the crux of events and influence things relevant to one of the [[Genius Loci]]'s manipulations of time and fate. This gives a character a certain ontological weight which is often largely unnoticeable, but practically means that things will go just well enough for them to make their future appointment with destiny - which may not even ever happen as they may be a third order fallback plan or something like that. A Fatespawned who learns of their nature however can lean on this weight to manipulate events by placing themselves in a game of chicken against the universe. However, there is a limit of unlikeliness of events before it becomes easier for the [[Genius Loci]] to just find another vector of action, at which point the universe may call the Fatespawned's bluff. Playing a Fatespawned means at its base being the lucky one who escapes certain death and disaster, and ultimately growing into the ability to manipulate random events by putting yourself in their way. Master your powers and take control of your own possibilities before you meet your destiny and find that fate no longer needs you.
