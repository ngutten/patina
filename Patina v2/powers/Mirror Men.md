Occasionally a doctor will inform someone that they will be having twins, but only one child is born. Some times, that might mean that a Mirror Man has been born. A Mirror Man effectively has two bodies separated by a thin phasic layer. By honing their awareness of the other body, they can displace the two bodies a limited amount relative to each-other, have one 'pull' the other, or even move small objects across the phasic layer. It's no wonder that many end up in the underworld, as they make the perfect thieves - able to scout locations without being seen, make objects vanish from within locked containers, and do other similar trickery. It is even possible for some to share injuries between their two bodies to lessen them - allow their other heart to pump blood for both bodies, etc. They also have enormous appetites - they are eating for two, after all.
