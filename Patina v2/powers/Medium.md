This is a form of [[Shared Soul]] origin in which part of the character's soul is connected to the preserved copies of the worlds' minds stored in the [[Sephrel Network]]. This generally occurs due to the character being colonized by a residual non-sapient [[Thanatoform]] during the period of soul formation. Effectively this co-locates their soul with an information signature recognized by the network, meaning that they can interact with that network of stored minds but also meaning that the stored minds can interact with them.

### Abilities

Mediums can draw upon the collected knowledge of those who have passed on, as well as the more esoteric knowledge of the ancients and even potentially that of the [[Sephrel]] themselves. Mediums only ever directly perceive the [[Sephrel Network]] while dreaming. During this time they can make contacts with specific [[Spirit Mentors]], seek out particular departed minds, or otherwise explore the network. 

Upon waking, the Medium retains an awareness of any minds they have so marked even if the details of the mental space of the network remain fragmentary and dreamlike. They may call upon the skills, knowledge, or personalities of those minds to different degrees, or even hold mental conversation with them. A skilled Medium also has the ability to exploit the fact that their own mind is backed up on the network, recovering lost, suppressed, or modified memories. Some say that a Medium may even return from brain death should their body somehow be restored to function.

Like all [[Shared Soul]] characters, Mediums have the additional [[Attribute]] [[Resonance]] 
### Hazards
Because the [[Sephrel Network]] was taken over by the emergent [[Great Mind]] [[Melivirin]] long ago, Mediums may also become entangled in its schemes if their access to the network is overt enough to be noticed. Another risk of being a Medium is that there remains unexploded psychic ordnance from the great war between the [[Seamind]] and [[Melivirin]] and mentally traversing the wilder parts of the [[Sephrel Network]] can lead one to run afoul of this.

The community of Mediums do not understand the explicit reasons for these hazards - rather, occasionally a Medium who draws too deeply of their talent ends up going mad, meets a bad end, or otherwise suffers a sudden change of personality. The general thought is along the lines that the living are not meant to dwell in the realms of the dead and vice versa, so a Medium's touch upon that realm should be brief and with serious purpose.
