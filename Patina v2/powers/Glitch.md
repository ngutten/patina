Glitches don't interface correctly with the [[Information Layer]] of reality - everything from divinatory practices to mundane record keeping just tends to shift and screw up their information. Film will show a smudge or chemical burn where they stand, wax recordings will capture garbled static when they speak, even plaster molds of their body will warp or fail to solidify correctly. A Glitch can usually be remembered by individuals, especially those they interact with frequently, but society's collective memory fails to grab hold of them. They're also nearly a perfect counter for memetic effects and psionic powers - such things find nothing to grab onto; however, in turn, Glitches cannot use such powers themselves, not really. But a Glitch can learn how to contaminate records, even minds, with their un-recordable information. And at the extreme ends of mastery, a Glitch may realize that even the chain of cause and effect is a 'record' of their existence that can be fuzzed, though in leaning into that too deeply they may forget themselves.
