The [[Inner Custodian]] continues to direct the evolution of multicellular life towards its ultimate ends. You are a prototype of a new iteration of humanity, an idea hyper-evolved in a narrow direction to see what's there and whether it should ultimately become part of the whole. If this stops at character creation, you've got some nifty power or ability that most people don't, perhaps along with some visibly odd characteristics, and that's it. 

But there's potential beyond that - your features are not just from pure genetic tampering, but are actively produced and maintained via epigenetic modification by [[Tychorex]] nanites. Find the path to influencing, even reprogramming them and you might be able to direct your evolution within your own lifetime. Mechanically, this is largely a one-off power for a one-off XP expenditure, with the potential for eventually unlocking a subsystem via in-character actions. However, unlocking that subsystem is not automatic or guaranteed - doing so would be a large-scale racial goal on par with the sorts of things BBEGs get up to in the superhero genre - so don't take this if the initial powers you can pick from aren't appealing.
