While characters may do specific things with their time off-screen (e.g. [[Extended Tasks]] such as crafting), all characters have (at baseline) a single downtime 'slot' that represents something they passively work on a few hours a day while other things are going on, either giving a temporary bonus or working towards non-XP acquisitions of knowledge or skill (learning a new language, an instrument, etc).

Very demanding circumstances can cause a character to lose access to their downtime slot - its hard to do strength training when doing a death march through the jungle, and so on.

At base, a downtime slot can be allocated to:
- Temporarily raising any one [[Attribute]] by +1. Takes one month to establish, lasts for one month after stopping (and can be freely picked up again during that time).
- Morale - Partying, resting, other forms of self-care. Reduces the effective Severity of any Morale-related conditions by 1 while sustained; in the absence of penalties, grants +1 [[Resistance]] to negative mental conditions.
- Spending 2 hours a day on an additional [[INTERRUPTIBLE]] [[Extended Task]], usually corresponding to about 1/4 rate of normal progress.
- Studying a language, instrument, weapon, or other similar 'subcategory'. This happens gradually, starting at a -5 effective penalty with that penalty being reduced by 1 per increment of time spent in study. Each increment of time takes `30-Intellect` days (minimum 1) of downtime.
- Retraining - 1xp released per day of downtime spent.
- Social development - increases a character's presence and connections within a particular social group they have access to, generates opportunities from that direction. 
- Searching for leads/getting into trouble - prompts the GM to generate hooks for this character that they stumble upon randomly. Depending on how this is done, could just be information or could drag the character in.
