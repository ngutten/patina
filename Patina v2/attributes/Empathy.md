This is a character's ability to passively model others, sense and comprehend emotions and motivations, and the degree to which their mind can sustain mental connections with other minds (assuming some actual mechanism for forming the connection has come into play). Aside from modifying skills, Empathy determines the scaling of some [[Psionics|Psionic]] abilities as far as number of people involved and range. 

Additionally, the GM should take into account a character's [[Empathy]] when narrating the actions of others. An [[Empathy]] of 1 or 2 should receive only flat narration of the actions others are taking. In the range of 3 to 4, the GM should include emotion and simple hypothesized motivations or rationales where applicable. An [[Empathy]] of 5+ might include narration of more complex considerations another character is balancing, subtle cues or internal conflicts they have about their course of action, or even anticipate the intent to act shortly before action takes place. These applications are purely at the GM narration layer - players who specifically want to analyze a character's reasoning or motivation beyond that layer may initiate Tasks using appropriate Skills.
