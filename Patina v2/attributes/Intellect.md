Intellect drives a number of mental Tasks involving memory, reasoning, and learning. In addition, a higher Intellect reduces the time it takes to pick up new types of art, new crafts, new categories of weapons, and new languages.

Additionally, Intellect reduces the additional risk dice incurred by [[Improvisation]] by 1 dice per point of [[Intellect]]. This does not reduce risk dice from [[Fatigue]], conditions, or circumstantial considerations.
