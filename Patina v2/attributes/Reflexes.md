Reflexes determines how fast a character can move at tactical scale, how immediately they can respond, and their ability to interrupt the actions of others. It also acts as a passive defense in combat, setting the `ST` for an opponent to plausibly hit you; and as a 'passive attack' of sorts, determining the `ST` for an opponent to dodge your attacks.
- A character can freely move `6m + 1m x Reflexes` per round in combat as a baseline, prior to any use of [[Athletics]] to run or sprint faster.
- A character's [[REACTION]] tasks may only **interrupt** (e.g. abort or force modification of) someone else's actions if they have a higher [[Reflexes]] than the other character. This basically governs order of resolution e.g. if A attacks B and B counter-attacks A, the counter-attack from B could knock A out and prevent the attack entirely only if B has higher [[Reflexes]].
- When multiple characters are trying to simultaneously act, [[Reflexes]] determines the order of initiative with higher [[Reflexes]] characters having the option to go first or delay their action. Ties go to player characters.
- The base `ST` to hit someone with an attack is `2+(their) Reflexes`. The base `ST` to dodge someone's attack is `3+(their) Reflexes`.
