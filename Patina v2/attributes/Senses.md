This Attribute determines the range and sensitivity of a character's senses - both mundane and supernatural. 
- In normal lighting and conditions, a character's range for potentially detecting another person trying to be [[Stealth|Stealthy]] is `10yd x Senses` (reduced by half in bad lighting, half again in busy environments like crowds or cluttered spaces, doubled with favorable position, etc).
- The `ST` to hit something with a ranged weapon is increased by +1 for every interval of `10yd x Senses` (up to the weapon's own maximum range). Scoped weapons, etc may modify this.
- Characters with higher Senses should receive more details, and more frequently only the pertinent details, when the GM describes the scene to them or the results of their closer inspection of something. 
- Similarly, when deciding if a character notices hidden things which they are **not actively looking for**, the GM should consider the character's raw [[Senses]]. This is not a Task, cannot be bolstered with [[Focus]], and might factor in other things about a character such as their previously demonstrated interests, level of attention, etc - it's a GM call, not an interactive event, and does not correspond directly to the `ST` the task would have if the character were actively looking.
