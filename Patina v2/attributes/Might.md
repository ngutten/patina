In addition to capping expenditure of [[Stamina]] on [[Might]]-based skills, [[Might]] determines the following things:
- For each level of [[Might]], the character can comfortably carry or wear one 'weight unit' worth of items without penalty - approximately 5lbs, but more focused on individual distinct heavy objects or grouped collections of objects. Things worn on the full body have their weight count as half, and 'normal clothing' including e.g. an oiled rainjacket or trenchcoat do not count against this limit. Exceeding this, up to double the limit, imposes a +1 [[Stamina]] cost on all physical tasks. This becomes a +2 cost at triple the limit and a +3 cost at quadruple the limit. Characters generally cannot further exceed their carrying capacity and still move or act normally.
- Each level of [[Might]] additionally reduces any ST penalties to tasks from wearing heavy armor or from using a particularly oversized or heavy object by 1, to a minimum of zero.
- [[Might]] adds to the [[Penetration]] score of bludgeoning melee weapons.
