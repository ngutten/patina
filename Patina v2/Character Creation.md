This is a quick summary of the mechanical aspects of character creation. See the particular sections for details. Characters begin with 100xp to spend on skills, advantages, and backgrounds.
- Assign Attributes according to the array: 5, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2
- Pick a [[Supernatural Origins|Supernatural Origin]]
- Pick a [[Background]]. Among other bonuses, some backgrounds give free skill ranks - these are applied after any ranks bought with XP but still obey the normal limits.
- Purchase [[Advantage|Advantages]] with XP
- Purchase [[Skill|Skills]] with XP
- Finalize the details of any [[Resources and Holdings]] provided by the character's [[Background]] or means - funds, property, items of note, contacts, subordinates, etc.

Outside of the mechanical aspects of character creation, it is suggested to have in mind:
- What does this character owe the world? Is there a duty the character carries, a vision of the world they are driven by, a tradition they uphold?
- What does the world owe this character? Is there some injustice they've suffered, some unacceptable aspects of their situation or relationship with society, some vengeance they are owed?
- What secret insights does the character have about the true nature of things, what things are they confidently wrong about, and what things are they ignorant of?
- Define a connection with at least two other players' characters.
