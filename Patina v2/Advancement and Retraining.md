### Advancement

Characters gain 3xp per game session normally. Whenever any party member accomplishes a personal milestone, or when the group as a whole accomplishes a group milestone or goal, the GM may award bonus experience to the party as a whole at their discretion, generally around 5-10xp. Players are encouraged to make their goals explicit to help the GM identify important milestones.

Experience may be spent as follows:
- [[Attribute]]: 3xp per new rank squared, natural maximum of 8
- [[Skill]]: 1xp per new rank, natural maximum of 8
- [[Specialization]]: 1xp per new rank, maximum of `Skill-2`
- [[Advantage]]: Must meet prerequisites, each has an individual price
### Retraining

Players may release non-Birth-only character options purchased with XP in order to reclaim that XP and spend it elsewhere. Doing so requires a day of downtime per point of XP released or for the GM to waive the retraining times (e.g. in the case of a rules change or misunderstanding, or if the things being retrained in particular should be easy to release).
