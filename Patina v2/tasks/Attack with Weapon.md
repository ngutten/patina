Attacking with a weapon is a baseline `ST 2 + Reflexes` [[Dexterity]]/[[Aggression]] task (using the target's Reflexes for the `ST` here). Targets who are unaware or inanimate behave as Reflexes 0. Additional factors such as other nearby clustered targets or defenders, unstable footing, poor visibility, extreme range in the case of ranged weapons, or differences in the target size from a human baseline may increase this `ST` further.

The **interval** of this task is 10 seconds for most weapons, e.g. one combat round. Very large weapons (siege weaponry, cannons, etc) may have longer intervals.

A target may additionally perform a [[Dodge]] or [[Parry]] to negate an attack with a weapon if applicable. This is a separate task on the target's part.

When a melee attack goes through, the weapon, the attacker's [[Might]], and the defender's [[Resistance]] in the form of armor are considered. The attacker can choose to apply any amount of [[Might]] to the attack to determine its [[Penetration]], but if this exceeds the weapon's rating then the weapon will be damaged or broken as part of the attack.

In the case of a ranged attack, the weapon's [[Penetration]] is simply used without modification.

Before [[Resistance]], a successful attack with a weapon applies a Severity 3 [[Injury]] to a random location by default (some weapons in particular may specifically add extra conditions, or threaten higher severity wounds). The hit location is mostly relevant for PCs and more serious individual enemies. In the case of larger crowds of weaker foes, just assume that if 2 or more severity gets through, the enemy is knocked out, otherwise they require an extra hit.

| d20   | Location  |
| ----- | --------- |
| 1-7   | Torso     |
| 8-10  | Left leg  |
| 11-13 | Right leg |
| 14-16 | Left arm  |
| 17-19 | Right arm |
| 20    | Head      |

Specific [[Subskills]] are required to enable called shots. There are also [[Subskills]] which allow attacking to treated as an [[Extended Task]], accumulating score until a hit lands or even interleaving general 'fighting' with specific moves.
