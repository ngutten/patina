The crafting and engineering of items, vehicles, buildings, etc is highly modular. Beyond the properties of 'the base item', additional modifiers and functions may be added at the cost of increasing the ST, Intervals required, and material demands of the project. Generally each additional property added always adds at least one Interval.

There are a variety of modifiers that can be added at the cost of increasing the ST and Intervals required for a particular project.

Here are the common modifiers that generally any experienced crafter might choose to apply. Other special modifiers may be enabled by specific subskills, materials, or independent research.
#### Refinement and Quality

Fine and Exquisite objects: These have no functional bonuses, but increase the perceived value of the object, its sale price, and the social status associated with using and owning them. Nobility generally use Fine-grade objects and clothing at minimum when entertaining or in the eyes of the public. Exquisite-grade objects would be potentially considered unique works of art or national treasures. These are mutually exclusive modifiers.

**Fine**: +4 ST, +4 Intervals, 3x material costs. Sell value increased by 10x. 
**Exquisite**: +8 ST, +8 Intervals, 10x material costs. Sell value increased by 100x. The ST may be increased beyond this but will not further modify the direct sell value or time or material costs - however, it can show off the artisan's skill and will be noticeable during appraisal, and can influence how the object's value appreciates over time.

**Durability**: For +1/+3/+6 ST and +1/+3/+6 Intervals, the object's resistance to damage is increased by +1/+2/+3.

**Redundant Design**: For +2 ST and +50% material cost and weight, the object or vehicle has redundancies that allow it to keep operating even in the case of damage or malfunction. The object treats any negative conditions affecting it as if they were one level lower for the purpose of penalties.

**Ergonomics**: Specifically for objects used as tools as part of some other work, a talented crafter can design objects to be easier to use and more helpful towards a single specific, narrow task. This grants a +1/+2/+3 Equipment Bonus on the user's skill when doing that particular task, at a cost of a +2/+6/+14 increase in ST. The tool has to be appropriate and used directly as part of the task - e.g. this modifier does not make magic item sorts of things like a  'ring of fighting better', nor does it specifically refer to indirect benefits like e.g. safety gloves used during machining, or a 'beautiful dress of being more persuasive because you're more beautiful with it'. Multiple sources of Equipment Bonus do not stack.

**Weapon [[Penetration]]**: Increasing the [[Penetration]] of a weapon through crafting technique is possible for edged and piercing weapons, at a cost of +2 ST/+6 ST to increase [[Penetration]] by +1 or +2 respectively. Exotic materials or material processing steps may also provide additional bonuses here which do stack.
#### Materials

**Structural Reduction**: +2 ST, +1 Interval. Material reduction decreases both the structural material costs for an item as well as its final weight by 25%. For +5 ST and +3 Intervals, this is a 50% reduction. In the case of body armor, these reductions decrease the [[Encumberance]] by 1 and 2 respectively to a minimum of zero.

**Efficiency Increase**: For +4 ST and +1 Interval, the required amount of special materials from which a craft draws its essential properties (the active ingredients of a medicine for example) can be reduced by 25%. This can be increased to a 50% reduction for +8 ST and +3 Intervals.

**Layered Armor**: Specifically for armor, more material may be added to armor to increase its defensive rating by +1 **but also** increasing its penalties by +2 at the cost of +2 ST and an increase in material costs and weight by 50%. This can be combined with **Structural Reduction** to cancel out some of the penalties but preserve the defense improvement. If this modification is focused towards a particular kind of damage (fire, bludgeoning, etc) then the defensive rating may be increased by +2; however, this cannot be combined with an across-the-board increase. Defensive improvements from layering stack with improvements from the use of special materials.

**Exotic Materials**: Replacing the basic material of a craft, or adding additional processing to materials directly can grant properties or modified stats based on the specific material or process. This increases the ST based on the specific material on a case by case basis - generally compatible materials are around +1 and awkward materials (such as a glass handle on a knife) are +3, but rare exotics may be inherently difficult to work with. All such substitutions generally incur an additional +1 Interval of work required.
#### Mechanisms

Generally some simple mechanisms can be added by any crafter without requiring a dedicated subskill for mechanism design or clockwork - things like latches, hinges, ratchets, modular pieces, etc. 

**Retractable**: Some part of the object can be retracted in order to make it take less space, to protect the user from an edge or snag, or to create a hidden pocket or drawer. This adds +1 ST and +1 Interval if it is done in an obvious way, or +3 ST and +3 Intervals to make it hidden enough to not be seen casually by eye. To make a truly hidden compartment that can resist a dedicated search, add the **Hidden** modification on top of this.

**Hidden**: For +3/+6/+9 ST and +1/+2/+3 Intervals, the object is treated as having its own [[Stealth]] pool with 1, 2, or 3 points in it, dedicated towards concealing some aspect of the object's function.

**Multi-function**: Mostly for tools, this turns something into a bit of a swiss army knife, allowing distinct functions to be combined in a single craft. For compatible functions that don't need to integrate (such as adding a claw to the back of a hammer), this is just +1 ST and +1 Interval each. For compatible functions that require integration (a car that is also a boat), this costs +3 ST and +3 Intervals. For incompatible functions where using the tool one way would damage or interfere with its ability to be used the other way or the ergonomics just don't make sense, this can be much higher or even outright impossible without subskill or technological support - a dress that is also a sword, etc. 

Material cost and weight increases are judged case-by-case - essentially, if the functions share some common backbone then this does not need to be paid twice (such as in the case of the boat-car, the same engine can be used); however, something like adding a second blade to a switchblade would be strictly additive.

**Modular**: The object is designed so that some parts of it can be swapped out relatively conveniently, either for different parts with different attributes or functions, for replacement of damaged parts, or just for storage purposes. Increases the ST by +1 and requires +1 Interval. This must also be applied to the modular parts if they are constructed as an independent craft. Some things are inherently modular already, such as a bow and its arrows. This does not need to be applied separately in the case of those sorts of objects.

**Quick-release**: Specifically for clothing and armor, this modification makes it faster and easier to get out of. For +1/+3 ST and +1 Interval, the item can be unequipped as a 10 second task, or instantly as a non-task respectively.

**Quick-equip**: Similarly to the above, but for equipping the item in the first place. For +3 ST and +1 Interval an item that would normally need assistants to equip can be done by the user themselves, and the time required is reduced by 50%. Going beyond this would require specific sub-skills or technology.
